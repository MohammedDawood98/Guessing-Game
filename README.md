# Guessing-Game
Guessing game 
This program generates a random number between 1 and some maximum value
 * controlled by a class constant. The program then prompts the user
 * to guess the number. When the user guesses incorrectly, the game gives the
 * user a hint about whether the correct answer is higher or lower than the
 * guess. Once the user guesses correctly, the program asks the user if they
 * would like to play again. The game repeats until the user chooses to quit.
 * When the user chooses to quit, the program displays a summary of statistics
 * including the number of games played, the total number of guesses made, the
 * average number of guesses per game, the minimum number of guesses (best
 * game), and the maximum number of guesses (worst game).
 * 
 * This implementation demonstrates the use of various types of loop structures.
 * All looping structures are represented: while loop do/while loop for loop
 * Infinite for loop with break infinite while loop with break
 * 
 * The loops have been commented to show the purpose of each.
 * 
 * It is a bit artificial to use every type of loop in this program. The only
 * reason to do so was for demonstration purposes. The program could have been
 * written with fewer types of loops. The choice of which type of loop is best to
 * use in each case is open to debate.
